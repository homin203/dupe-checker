## Main Goal: 
  ####  Problem Solving

## Analyze the given problem
  ####  Whether if the two or more files are identical in terms of ...
    - This should be end up with having a THOROUGH Specification (set of sub problems)

  ####   Sub Problems
    - How to read files
    - Binary, Raw string, array of characters,
    - Ignore White spaces
    - Character validation
       *Invalid characters should be ignored (or whatever)*
    ...

## Plan & Documentation
  1. Prioritization
  2. ETC (Estimated Time for Completion)
      - How to read files (***) - 2hrs
  3. Test Plan => ASSERTIONS [90% of quality is determined by this]
      - Prevent Runtime Error by persisting Fast-Fail
  4. Pseudo-Code with Documentation
  5. Algorithms or Libraries

  e.g.
    Ignore white spaces (****) - 2hrs (10/10)

## Implementation
  ####  do
      Control Structure
        Functional vs. OOP
        STL vs. UDL
      Data Structure
        Array, Struct, Dynamic vs. Static, ...etc
  ####  while (Refactoring)
  ...
